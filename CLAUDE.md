# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository. Read it fully at the
start of every session — it is the source of truth for architecture, workflow, and where the
project currently stands.

## What this is

Hexagare is a product/inventory/billing system, initially for a custom mouse pad business
(sells on Amazon + offline) but built to work for **any product category** — nothing in the
design should be mouse-pad-specific. Backend: Django REST API (`backend/hexagare`). Frontend:
React + Vite + TypeScript (`frontend`). Run together via Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, Redis,
and Celery. This repo starts empty — nothing described below exists yet. It gets built phase by
phase per `HEXAGARE_BUILD_PROMPTS.md`, and this file's **Current Phase** section (bottom) tracks
exactly how far along it is.

---

## Target Architecture

This is the intended design for the whole project. Build toward it phase by phase — don't build
a different shape "for now" without recording why in `docs/decisions.md` as an ADR.

- **Modular monolith**: one Django/DRF backend split into domain apps under
  `backend/hexagare/apps/`: `accounts`, `products`, `inventory`, `sales`, `integrations`,
  `billing`, `customers`, `purchases`, `suppliers`, `expenses`, `reports`, `notifications`,
  `common`. Add functionality to the domain app it belongs to, not a catch-all.
- **Settings** live in `backend/hexagare/hexagare/settings/` — `base.py` holds shared config,
  `development.py`/`staging.py`/`production.py` extend it, selected via the `DJANGO_ENV` env var.
  Environment-specific config never goes in `base.py`.
- **API versioning**: all routes mounted under `/api/v1/` in `hexagare/urls.py`, one `include()`
  per app's `urls.py` (`DefaultRouter` for viewsets, explicit `path()` for non-CRUD actions).
- **Auth & RBAC**: JWT via `rest_framework_simplejwt`, `IsAuthenticated` by default. Roles →
  permission-name sets live in `apps/accounts/rbac.py`, materialized into Django
  `Group`/`Permission` objects via `ensure_role_groups()`, enforced with custom `BasePermission`
  subclasses built on `apps/accounts/permissions.py:HasOperationalPermission`. Grep `rbac.py`
  before inventing a new permission codename — some codenames may already be reserved for
  features not built yet. Multi-action viewsets gate per-action via `get_permissions()`, not one
  fixed `permission_classes`.
- **Response envelopes**: a global DRF `EXCEPTION_HANDLER`
  (`apps.common.exceptions.api_exception_handler`) normalizes errors to
  `{"error": {"code", "message", "fields"?}}`; list endpoints go through
  `apps/common/pagination.py:StandardPagination` → `{"data": [...], "meta": {"count", "next",
  "previous"}}` (`page`, `page_size`, max 100). Never return raw DRF shapes from a new view.
  Binary responses (barcode images, label/invoice PDFs) go through
  `apps/common/renderers.py:BinaryRenderer`.
- **Catalog model** (`apps/products`): `Category` → `Product` → `ProductVariant`, plus
  `ProductAttribute`/`ProductAttributeValue` for data-driven variant properties (size, color,
  material — never product-specific columns), `ProductImage`, `LabelSize`. **SKU is a unique
  column on `ProductVariant`**, not a separate model; pricing (`mrp`, `selling_price`,
  `purchase_price`, `tax_rate`) are also columns on `ProductVariant`. This is a deliberate,
  documented simplification (see ADR-002 once Phase 0 creates it) — don't "upgrade" it to
  standalone entities without a new ADR.
- **Serialized units** (`apps/products`): each physical unit gets an immutable, globally unique
  serial number (`<HEXAGARE_SERIAL_PREFIX><variant-code>-<zero-padded sequence>`, e.g.
  `HXMP1123-000001`; prefix/padding from `HEXAGARE_SERIAL_PREFIX`/`HEXAGARE_SERIAL_PADDING`
  settings, distinct from `HEXAGARE_SKU_PREFIX`) allocated under a Postgres advisory lock, and a
  required `location` FK (`apps.inventory.Location`) — no free-text location field.
  `SerializedInventoryService` is the **only** path allowed to transfer/sell/damage/lose/return a
  unit — it locks the unit row, applies the model's own `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` state machine, and
  records a matching `InventoryTransaction` in the same atomic block. Never bypass it with a
  direct field edit. Barcodes are Code128 renderings of the serial, generated **on demand**,
  never stored as images.
- **Inventory ledger** (`apps/inventory`): `Location` (generic stock-holding place, seed rows
  Warehouse/Amazon/Offline via a `post_migrate` bootstrap hook, classified by `kind` for
  reporting only — never branch on name) and `InventoryBalance` (read cache) are never written
  to directly — `apps/inventory/services/ledger.py:InventoryService` is the only writer, and
  every change produces an immutable `InventoryTransaction` row, optionally tagged with a
  `serialized_unit` kwarg.
- **Sales/orders are channel-agnostic** (`apps/sales`): `SalesChannel` (seed rows
  `AMAZON`/`OFFLINE`, extensible with zero code changes — never hardcode a channel name/code in
  logic) and one generic `Sale`/`SaleLine` model for every channel, no per-channel schemas.
  `Sale.subtotal/discount_total/tax_total/grand_total` are derived, read-only —
  `apps/sales/services/totals.py:SalesTotalsService` is the only writer, recalculating from lines
  under a row lock whenever a line changes. `Payment`/`Invoice`/`InvoiceDelivery`, and wiring
  sale completion to the inventory ledger (`SerializedInventoryService.sell()` on payment), get
  built together — don't build one without the other.
- **Amazon order import** (`apps/integrations`): CSV-only to start —
  `apps/integrations/amazon/sources.py:AmazonOrderSource` is the abstraction a future SP-API
  adapter implements; `AmazonOrderImportService` depends only on that interface, never on CSV
  parsing directly. Amazon-specific per-line financials (fees, shipping, advertising, refunds,
  net revenue) live on `AmazonOrderSettlement`, not on `Sale`/`SaleLine` — same pattern for any
  future channel-specific data. Idempotent by design: `Sale` keyed on
  `(sales_channel, external_reference)`, `AmazonOrderSettlement` on `(sale, sku)`. Runs via a
  Celery task, never inline on the upload request.
- **Async work**: Celery + Redis for anything slow or externally delivered (PDFs, email/WhatsApp,
  image processing, Amazon import, exports). Pattern: commit the business transaction in Postgres
  first, enqueue the Celery task after — never hold an HTTP request open for this. Tasks live in
  each app's `tasks.py`, autodiscovered via `hexagare/celery.py`. Test with
  `@override_settings(CELERY_TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER=True, CELERY_TASK_EAGER_PROPAGATES=True)`.
- **Media/files**: object storage (S3 via `django-storages`), not local container paths in
  staging/production — Postgres stores metadata/object keys only. In development, `MEDIA_ROOT` is
  a local volume-mounted directory.
- API schema auto-generated via `drf-spectacular`, served at `/api/schema/` and `/api/docs/`.
- **Cross-app model references** use string FKs (e.g. `models.ForeignKey("inventory.Location",
  ...)`) to avoid circular imports — an established pattern, not something to "fix."
- **Docs that are authoritative once Phase 0 creates them** — read before structural changes:
  `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/domain-model.md`, `docs/decisions.md` (ADR log),
  `docs/serialized-units.md`, `docs/amazon-order-import.md`. Keep them updated as each phase adds
  or changes a structural decision — a stale doc is worse than no doc.

## Commands

All commands run through Docker Compose (a `Makefile` wraps the common ones — created in Phase 0):

```
make up              # docker compose up --build — postgres, redis, backend, celery-worker, celery-beat, frontend
make down
make logs
make migrate         # docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py migrate
make test            # docker compose run --rm backend python manage.py test
make lint            # ruff check on backend, npm run lint on frontend
make seed            # docker compose exec backend python manage.py seed_demo_data
make backend-shell
make frontend-shell
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` before first run and set a real `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`. Seed reference
data (Locations, SalesChannels, RBAC role groups) is created automatically on every `migrate` via
`post_migrate` hooks — not by `make seed`, which only adds demo products/users.

Run a single Django test: `python manage.py test apps.<app>.tests.<module>.<TestCase>.<method>`
(inside the backend container). Backend lint: `ruff check --no-cache .` from `backend/hexagare`.
Frontend (from `frontend/`): `npm run dev`, `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build` — the only
type-check), `npm run lint`, `npm run preview`.

## Development Workflow — Plan Before Development

For every development task, **do not immediately start writing or modifying code.**

### Phase A — Understand the Request
1. Read the request in full, including which numbered phase of `HEXAGARE_BUILD_PROMPTS.md` it
   corresponds to.
2. Identify expected behavior and acceptance criteria.
3. Identify what's unclear or ambiguous.
4. Inspect the existing codebase for related/similar implementations already present.
5. Identify all affected areas: Frontend, Backend, API, Database, Auth/RBAC, Tests,
   Configuration, Third-party integrations, Deployment/CI.

Do not make code changes during this phase.

### Phase B — Create a Plan
Present: **Goal** (what and why) · **Current Implementation** (how it works today, if anything)
· **Files to Change** (created/modified, and what changes in each) · **Implementation Steps** (in
order — e.g. API validation → business logic → frontend integration → UI → tests → lint/type
checks → verify) · **Risks** (breaking changes, data integrity, security, performance, backward
compatibility) · **Testing Plan** · **Chrome DevTools Verification** (for frontend/UI changes —
skip and note "verified manually" if Chrome DevTools MCP isn't connected).

### Phase C — Stop for Approval
**Stop and wait for approval before modifying code.** Do not create, modify, or delete files, run
migrations, change dependencies, or implement anything until the user approves. Valid approvals:
`approved`, `go ahead`, `start`, or requested changes to the plan (update and ask again).

**Exception:** if the user explicitly says something like *"make the plan and implement it
without waiting for approval,"* proceed after presenting the plan.

### Phase D — Development
Follow the approved plan. Smallest appropriate changes. Follow the Target Architecture above and
existing conventions. Reuse existing services/utilities/components. No unnecessary dependencies,
no unrelated refactoring, no unrelated file changes. If implementation reveals the approved plan
is wrong or incomplete: **stop and explain the required change before continuing.**

### Phase E — Testing
Run the relevant checks (unit/integration/API/frontend tests, type checking, linting, build) using
the commands above. Never claim a test passed unless it actually ran. If a test fails: investigate,
determine if it's caused by this change, fix if appropriate, re-run. Never ignore a failing test.

### Phase F — Chrome DevTools Verification
For frontend/UI/browser changes, use Chrome DevTools MCP when connected and the app can run
locally: page loads, console errors, network errors/status codes, JS runtime errors, UI behavior
(forms, buttons, navigation, loading/error states), responsive layout, the relevant user flow.
Don't declare a frontend task complete without this when the MCP is available.

### Phase G — Final Review + Update This File
Before reporting completion:
1. Review the final git diff for accidental changes, debug statements, secrets/credentials.
2. Confirm tests were added/updated where necessary and the implementation matches the plan.
3. Confirm verification (automated or manual) was done.
4. **Update the "Current Phase" section below** — mark the just-finished phase done, name the
   next phase from `HEXAGARE_BUILD_PROMPTS.md`, and note any deviation from that file's prompt
   (so the next session isn't surprised). Do this as part of finishing the task, not as a
   separate ask.
5. If a structural/architectural decision was made this phase, add an ADR to
   `docs/decisions.md` and update the relevant doc in `docs/`.

### Final Response Format
Report: **What Changed** (brief) · **Files Changed** (with what changed in each) · **Tests** (only
checks actually run, e.g. `✓ Unit tests` / `✓ ESLint` / `✓ TypeScript` / `✓ Production build` —
never list one as passed unless it ran) · **Chrome DevTools** (for frontend changes: `✓ Page
loaded` / `✓ Console checked` / `✓ Network checked` / `✓ Feature manually verified`, or "not
connected — verified manually") · **Notes** (implementation decisions, known limitations,
follow-up work).

## Current Phase

**Status:** Phase 0 done — backend scaffold, `apps.common` (error envelope / pagination / binary renderer / health), split settings, Celery, Docker Compose, Makefile, `.env.example`, doc stubs. `make test` (13 tests), `ruff check`, `spectacular --validate`, and a full `docker compose up` (backend + celery-worker + celery-beat + postgres + redis) all pass.
**Next up:** Phase 1 — Frontend Foundation + Accounts (Auth + RBAC) (see `HEXAGARE_BUILD_PROMPTS.md`).
**Completed phases:** Phase 0.
**Notes / deviations from the plan:** (1) S3/local storage switch uses Django 5.1+ `STORAGES` (keyed on `USE_S3`), not the removed `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` — same behaviour. (2) `manage.py`/`wsgi.py`/`asgi.py` keep `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=hexagare.settings`; env selection happens inside `settings/__init__.py` via `DJANGO_ENV`; `make test` passes `DJANGO_ENV=test`. (3) `docker-compose.yml` sets `name: hexagare` and backend host port is `${BACKEND_PORT:-8000}`. (4) Added `apps/common` health endpoint at `/api/v1/health/` and a repo `.gitignore` (not in the prompt). (5) Default `auth.User` for now — custom user in Phase 1 will need a DB volume reset (`docker compose down -v`). (6) `make seed` / `make frontend-shell` reference things built in later phases (matches CLAUDE.md).

*(Claude Code: update this section — Status, Next up, Completed phases, Notes — every time a
phase is finished, per Phase G of the workflow above. Keep it to these four lines so it stays
easy to scan at the start of a session.)*
